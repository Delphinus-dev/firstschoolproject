# School project : My Green City - Strasbourg
### Challenge
In October 2019, dyring our training at Wild Code School Strasbourg, 3 others students and me worked on our first school project, using SCRUM agile process framework. At that time, we had only learned HTML and CSS, so it's a very simple website.
The goal was to create a website about green initiatives in our city : Strasbourg.

I have since learned to develop great websites with multiple dynamic features, but it's nice to be able to see what I was able to create in the beginning and to compare with what I can do now.
If you want to see the difference, you can see my latest project here :
